#Phase 1: CategoriesController

In the first phase of our EasyShop Capstone project, significant progress has been made with the implementation of the CategoriesController. This controller now features robust methods for handling Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. It is essential to note that access to these operations is restricted to the administrator role. As a result, only administrators have the privilege to insert, update, and delete categories within the system.

#Phase 2: Debugging
We managed to debug many of the problems inherent in the program. This was a time consuming process but we did manage to fix the original bugs. This included fixing the filtering and search functions on the EasyShop website, finding and removing a bug that duplicated products in the store inventory, and fixing the Login function. allowing a user to login to our website.


#Phase 2: ProductsController

Building upon the foundation laid in Phase 1, the second phase focuses on the ProductsController. This integral component of our application now boasts well-defined endpoints to facilitate the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of products. Similarly to the CategoriesController, administrative access remains a prerequisite for performing insertions, updates, and deletions in the products database. This ensures a secure and controlled environment, where only authorized personnel can manage product-related data.


#Phase 3: ShoppingCartController


In the third phase, we attempted to implement the ShoppingCartController to enhance the shopping experience for our users. This controller was designed to support essential operations such as GET, POST, and DELETE, allowing users to interact with their shopping carts. Specifically, when users are logged in, they gain the ability to seamlessly add items to their carts, enhancing the overall user experience and convenience of our EasyShop platform. Unfortunately we were unable to implement this feature due to time constraits.
